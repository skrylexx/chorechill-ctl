# Chore Chill CTL

> A handmade fan control daemon for Linux, built to save an old MSI GF63 Thin from dying.

![Chore Chill Preview](readme_img/main_page.png)

Communicates directly with the **Embedded Controller (EC)** via `/sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io` to read CPU temperature and control fan speed at a low level.

## IPC Protocol

The frontend and daemon communicate over a UNIX socket at `/tmp/chorechill-ctl.sock`.

| Command | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | frontend → daemon | Poll current telemetry |
| `SET:<pct>` | frontend → daemon | Lock fan at `<pct>`% — daemon keeps re-writing every 100 ms to hold the EC |
| `SET_CURVE:<t1,...,t6>;<s1,...,s7>` | frontend → daemon | Push a fan curve into EC registers; EC runs it autonomously, re-write loop stops |

All commands return `<temp_c>,<fan_pct>,<rpm>` as the response.

> **Why the re-write loop?** The EC has its own thermal algorithm. Writing once to the fan speed register (`0x71`) only works for a few seconds — the EC overrides it. The daemon re-writes every 100 ms to hold manual mode. `SET_CURVE` writes to the curve registers (`0x6A–0x78`) which the EC enforces autonomously, so no re-write is needed.

## Prerequisites

- Linux with `ec_sys` kernel module available
- **Secure Boot must be disabled** (otherwise kernel lockdown blocks EC access)
- Python 3 + `python3-tk`
- GCC

Verify Secure Boot / lockdown status:
```bash
cat /sys/kernel/security/lockdown
# [none]  --> OK
# [integrity] or [confidentiality] --> disable Secure Boot in BIOS first
```

---

## Setup & Running

To install, compile, configure, and register the global service and client in one step, run the installer:

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Running the Client GUI

Once installed, simply start the graphical application from any terminal:

```bash
chorechill
```

### Managing the C Daemon (Systemd)

The background control daemon is registered as a systemd service. You can control it using standard systemd commands:

```bash
# Check service logs and status
sudo systemctl status chorechill-ctl

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart chorechill-ctl

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop chorechill-ctl
```

## How EC Addresses Were Found

The Embedded Controller (EC) exposes 256 bytes of RAM at `/sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io`.

### Method: hexdump differential analysis

```bash
# Take a baseline snapshot (idle, fans quiet)
sudo hexdump -C /sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io > idle.txt

# Trigger load to spin up fans (e.g. launch a heavy Docker stack)
# Then snapshot again
sudo hexdump -C /sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io > load.txt

# Compare
diff idle.txt load.txt
```

Bytes that spike under load → fan speed registers.  
Bytes that increase with heat → temperature registers.

> On this machine, fans were deliberately pushed by launching a Docker stack to cause visible peaks in the hexdump, making the fan register easy to identify.

### Validated addresses (MSI GF63 Thin)

| Component       | Address | Access     | Example values              |
|-----------------|---------|------------|------------------------------|
| CPU Temperature | `0x68`  | Read       | `0x36` (54°C) → `0x59` (89°C) |
| CPU Fan Speed   | `0x71`  | Read/Write | `0x2b` (43%) → `0x64` (100%)  |
| Fan Curve Temps | `0x6A–0x6F` | Write  | 6 temperature thresholds (°C) |
| Fan Curve Speeds| `0x72–0x78` | Write  | 7 speed percentages (%)       |
| GPU Temperature | `0x80`  | Read       | `0x00` (standby)            |
| GPU Fan Speed   | `0x89`  | Read/Write | `0x00` (off)                |

> **Note:** The EC has its own control loop — writing a curve to `0x6A–0x78` makes the EC enforce it automatically. For a manual lock (`SET:<pct>`), the daemon writes directly to `0x71`.

## Compatibility

> v0 targets the **MSI GF63 Thin** specifically (or machines with the same motherboard).  
> EC register layout varies by manufacturer and model.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a graphical curve editor allowing users to drag 7 points to configure their custom profile.
